## Project Overview
This project intends to investigate the Iris Dataset using several different analytical techniques and code. 

In order to do this, a program will be created that breaks down and outlines several features of the dataset.

The program title is analysis.py and should do the following:
- Output a summary of each variable into a single text file.
- Save a histogram of each variable to .png files.
- Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

Additonally, other analysis techniques may be used to further analyse the data.
