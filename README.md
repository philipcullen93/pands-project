## Project Overview
This project intends to investigate the Iris Dataset using several different analytical techniques and code. 

In order to do this, a program will be created that breaks down and outlines several features of the dataset.

The program title is analysis.py and should do the following:
- Output a summary of each variable into a single text file.
- Save a histogram of each variable to .png files.
- Output a scatter plot of each pair of variables.

Additonally, other analysis techniques may be used to further analyse the data.

## Summary of Paper
The data for this project original comes from "The Use of Multiple Measuremanets in Taxonomic Problems" by R. A. Fisher. The paper written in 1936, serves as a foundation for multivariate statisitcs. In the paper, Fisher took measurements of three different varients of the Iris flower. The Iris flowers used in the study were  *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*. For each flower he measured the petal length (cm), petal width (cm), sepal length (cm), and the sepal width (cm). from this Fish developed a statiscal method, linear discriminant. This method is ued to identify a clear combination of features for two or more objects but at the same time discriminate between them.

### Why is this important in data analytics
Fisher's linear discrimiant statistical model served as the foundation for Linear Disciminant Analysis (LDA), also known as normal discriminant analysis (NDA) or discriminant function analysis (DFA). This model is used in machine learning, bioinformatics, and pattern recognicition. This allows analysts to take large complex datasets and simplify them while still preserving each classes unique information. By doing this it allows for better visualisation and interpretation of highly complex datsets.
